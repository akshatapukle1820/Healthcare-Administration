<p>There is a huge range of factors on which a person’s health depends. These factors can be broadly classified into the following categories according to the World Health Organization:

The social and economic environment: This depends on how wealthy a family or a person is.
The physical environment: This includes the area in which a person is living, its atmospheric temperature, humidity, pollution level and also the parasites present there.
The person’s characteristics and behavior: This includes the genes possessed by a person and the lifestyle they chose to have.

 
 

Some of the other factors impacting health are as follows:

Physical environment: Clean and safe water and air, hygienic workplace and safe houses – All of these contribute for a better health.
Income and social status: Higher income and higher social status leads to better health as those people can afford the expenses of having a better environment.
Genetics: Inheritance plays a big role in a person’s health.
Gender: Men and women suffer from different types of diseases at different ages because of difference in their immune systems and hormones in the body.
Education level: The more educated the people are, the more they know about their well being.
Social support and network: Friends and family support helps in building better health. The kind of love and care taken particularly affects a person’s mental health.
